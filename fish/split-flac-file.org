#+title: Split a FLAC file

* Split a FLAC file
I didn't actually know that FLAC files could be produced as a single file for an entire album, as that seems insane. In order to turn them into useful files you need ~shntool~ and ~flac~ in Nix. Then run this in the correct directory:

#+begin_src shell
  shnsplit -f *.cue -t %n-%t -o flac *.flac
#+end_src

This seems to work as of 9 May 2020 with Fish v3.1.2. Obviously you then want to turn the flac files into more playable files or something.
